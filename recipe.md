<h2> Ingredients </h2>
1. large baguette or bread roll
2. medium onions
3. tbsp oil
4. tbsp balsamic vinegar
5. tbsp maple syrup
6. 200 g oyster mushrooms or mushrooms of choice
7. tbsp tamari/ soy sauce
8. tsp garlic powder
9. large tomato
10. few leaves of lettuce
11. tbsp vegan mayo

<h2>Instructions</h2>
 
- Peel and slice the onions
- Heat a non stick pan on high heat
- Add 1 tbsp of oil and once hot add the sliced onions, fry until they start to brown stirring regularly, this should take about 5 mins, as they start to shrivel and go golden add in the balsamic vinegar and 1.5 tbsp of maple syrup. Remove the pan from the heat and mix well. Set the onions aside and leave to cool.
- Rip up the mushrooms in long strips. Put the non stick pan back on high heat and once hot add 1 tbsp of oil and the mushrooms. Take another pan that fits inside this pan and put some baking parchment to cover the bottom of this pan and compress the pan down so that the mushrooms are being forced to evaporate more moisture and are forced to brown and grill more. Once they start to brown on once side turn them and repeat on the other side. Once they are brown all over, turn off the heat and mix the 2 tbsp of tamari, 1.5 tbsp of maple syrup and the garlic powder and add to the pan mixing well while still hot ensuring that each mushroom is well coated. Leave them to cool
- To bring together, slice the baguette lengthwise and add a generous dallop of vegan mayonnaise on each side, add a nice coating of caramelised onions to one side, next some sliced tomato, some lettuce and finish with a generous serving of the mushrooms. - Repeat with the other sandwich. Enjoy!
